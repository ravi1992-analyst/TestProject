# TestProject
Q1. Tools and technologies used to develop this frame work 
Q2. the reason behind the chosen framework and pattern
Q3. how to make the framework work and how to execute the test

  - Eclipse as an IDE 
  - Selenium, free automating testing frame work and the Scripting language used is java and the concepts used is OOPs concepts.
  - Maven project, used POM.xml files to load the dependencies. for that Mavenrepositories is used.
  - TestNG Framework used, here we have created the TestRunner.xml file to execute the test cases in one go with run as TestNG Suit. and with the help of @test annotation we can write the test cases.
  - Page Object model design pattern used and PageFactory implemention is implemented.
  - for pushing the code to the Repo. Git bash command line is used.
  
  Q4.next possible steps for improvement
  1.right now the user name and password are hardcoded, we can send the credentials at the time of the run time.
  2.some code is used frequently on the testcases, we can make it as a common test cases, which we say code reusability.
